Android Cheatsheet for Graphic Designers [DEPRECATED]
=====================================================

*Android Cheatsheet for Graphic Designers is deprecated. Use the [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/) instead.*

Graphic designers aren't programmers and sometimes don't know how to properly 
prepare graphic assets for developers. This simple cheatsheet should help them 
to do their job better, and to simplify developers' lives.
